This repo contains all of the code samples from my talk Dead-Simple
Async Control Flow with Coroutines given at the [New York NodeJS
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/nodejs/events/223578097/) on Aug. 19th,
2015.

## Running the code

You will need [babeljs](http://babeljs.io) in order to run the examples.
Simply type `babel-node <example-file>.js` to run the code.

To run the database cursoring example, you will need Postgresql and will
need to load the `usda.sql` file. See the `README` in the
`usda-r18-1.0/` directory for instructions.
